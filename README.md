## What is Song Describer?
Song Describer is an open-source data annotation tool for collecting and evaluating textual descriptions of music recordings. 

It was developed by a team of researchers from Queen Mary University of London and Universitat Pompeu Fabra Barcelona with the aim of crowdsourcing the first public research dataset of music captions.

The online app can be found at [song-describer.streamlit.app](https://song-describer.streamlit.app/).

## Overview
The Song Describer annotation process is structured into three main stages: user onboarding, annotation, and evaluation. The tool also provides additional features such as a leaderboard to display the users' progress and the ability to identify returning users via a unique user ID.

## How to run locally
Instructions on how to run the app locally can be found in the [annotation tool README](annotation_tool/README.md).
